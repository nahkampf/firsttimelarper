# So what's this larp thing?
This is a short guide for those who are curious about larp ("Live action role playing"), either wanting to try it out or just want to know what it is and how it's done, with an emphasis on answering some questions that prospective first time larpers might have.

> :warning: **Caveats:** Larp is a very wide and diverse hobby, with various "subcultures", traditions and styles - some of which are more prevalent in different countries. Not all larps are alike, and larps (the content, the rules systems, how players are expected to play them and a whole of unwritten rules or conventions) can be quite different in (to take an example) the US compared to Scandinavia. There is no *better* or *worse* kind of larping, it all comes down to traditions and whatever you (and the other players and organizers) want to do and how you want to do it.

> So there is no one "truth" as to what larp is (or should be). This guide is primarily maintaned by a Swedish larper (@nahkampf) and as such will (at least initially) be biased towards the "scandinavian" tradition of larps (see "Nordic Larp"), but I will strive to be as unbiased as possible and welcome any input and/or pull requests from other sources/traditions/experiences.

# What *is* larp?

Fundamentally, larp is role-playing. Players assume a role (also often referred to as a *character*), and act it out together with other players also acting out their respective roles, in the flesh. Players may or may not be in costume, there may or may not be *mechanics* in play (also often referred to as *rules* or *systems*), definining what actions and be performed and how. Larp is often described like an unscripted theatre play, performed by the players for the players. Think of larp as experiencing (or portraying) a person other than yourself for a while, reacting and acting and interacting as that person would rather than how you yourself would.
